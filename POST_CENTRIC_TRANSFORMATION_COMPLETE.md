# POST-CENTRIC TRANSFORMATION COMPLETE

## Summary

The PlaneMail application has been successfully transformed from a newsletter/template-centric workflow to a post-centric workflow. The new system allows users to create posts that can be sent as newsletters and published as web pages.

## New Workflow

The application now follows this step-by-step workflow:

1. **Create Post** → Basic post information (title, slug, excerpt)
2. **Compose** → Write the post content
3. **Audience** → Select target segments (optional)
4. **Email** → Configure email settings (optional)
5. **Web** → Configure web publishing settings (optional)
6. **Review** → Review and publish

## Database Changes

### New Tables Added
- `posts` - Main table for post content with support for both email and web publishing
- `post_segments` - Junction table linking posts to audience segments

### Legacy Tables (Marked for Deprecation)
- `newsletters` - Kept for backward compatibility but marked as legacy
- `templates` - Kept for backward compatibility but marked as legacy

### Posts Table Features
- Unified content storage for both email and web
- Email-specific fields: `emailSubject`, `fromName`, `fromEmail`, `sendingProviderId`
- Web-specific fields: `webEnabled`, `seoTitle`, `seoDescription`, `slug`
- Analytics fields: Email stats + `webViews` for web analytics
- Status tracking: `draft`, `published`, `scheduled`, `sent`

## New Features Implemented

- Email metrics: opens, clicks, delivery rates, industry benchmarks

### 4. Improved Navigation
