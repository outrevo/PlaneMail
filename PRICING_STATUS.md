# PlaneMail - Pricing & Trial Implementation - COMPLETED ✅

## 🎯 Issues Resolved

### 1. ✅ Fixed Paddle Trial Configuration
- **Problem**: Paddle was requesting credit card upfront with unclear trial setup
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed invalid `collection_mode` parameter causing API errors
  - Created new prices with proper 14-day trial configuration
  - Updated environment variables with new price IDs
- **Status**: Paddle trials now work correctly (standard behavior: card required but no charge during trial)

### 2. ✅ Fixed UI Overlap Issue  
- **Problem**: "Most Popular" and "14-Day Free Trial" badges were overlapping
- **Solution**: 
  - Repositioned trial badge to avoid overlap
  - Made trial badge position dynamic based on popular status
  - Popular plan: trial badge moves down (`top-8`)
  - Non-popular plans: trial badge stays at top (`-top-3`)
- **Status**: Badges now display correctly without overlap

## 📊 Current Configuration

### Paddle Setup
```bash
Environment: sandbox
Products: 3 (Hosted, Pro, Enterprise)

### Trial Behavior
