# Draft Posts Visibility & Theme Fixes - COMPLETED ‚úÖ

## üéØ Issues Resolved

### 1. **Draft Posts Not Visible in Production** ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Draft posts were being filtered out and not visible in the posts interface.
**Root Cause**: The posts page was only showing published posts due to filtering logic.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added tabbed interface with three views:
  - **All Posts**: Shows all posts regardless of status
  - **Drafts**: Shows only draft posts
  - **Published**: Shows only published/sent posts
- Updated filtering logic to respect the active tab
- Added dynamic empty state messages based on current tab
- Changed default view to "All Posts" to ensure drafts are visible

### 2. **Light/Dark Theme Issues in Editor** ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Novel editor components (slash commands, bubble menu, editor styles) were using hardcoded colors instead of theme-aware CSS variables.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Updated all hardcoded colors in `editor.css` to use CSS variables
- Fixed slash command menu to use `hsl(var(--popover))` instead of hardcoded colors
- Updated hover states to use `hsl(var(--accent))` and `hsl(var(--accent-foreground))`
- Fixed code blocks to use `hsl(var(--muted))` and proper theme colors
- Updated blockquotes, horizontal rules, and selection styles
- Fixed placeholder text colors to use `hsl(var(--muted-foreground))`
- Updated link colors to use `hsl(var(--primary))`
- Fixed highlight extension to use theme-aware `bg-accent/20`
