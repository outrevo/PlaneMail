# Next.js Metadata Export Fixes - Complete

## Overview
Fixed all Next.js metadata export errors that were occurring when components marked with `"use client"` attempted to export metadata, which is not allowed in Next.js.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Legal Pages Structure
- **Fixed**: Moved metadata from old `/privacy` and `/terms` routes to correct `/privacy-policy` and `/terms-of-service` routes
- **Removed**: Old directory structures `/app/privacy/` and `/app/terms/`
- **Action**: Converted all legal pages from client components to server components (removed `"use client"`)

### 2. Documentation Pages
Fixed metadata export errors in all documentation pages by removing `"use client"` directive:
- `/docs/page.tsx`
- `/docs/getting-started/page.tsx`
- `/docs/posts/page.tsx`
- `/docs/email-marketing/page.tsx`
- `/docs/web-publishing/page.tsx`
- `/docs/audience/page.tsx`
- `/docs/troubleshooting/page.tsx`

### 3. Sitemap Updates
- **Updated**: Fixed sitemap URLs from `/privacy` and `/terms` to `/privacy-policy` and `/terms-of-service`
- **Ensured**: All legal pages are properly indexed

### 4. Middleware Verification
- **Confirmed**: Middleware already includes correct public routes for `/privacy-policy` and `/terms-of-service`
- **Status**: No changes needed to middleware configuration

## Technical Details

### Root Cause
Next.js does not allow `export const metadata` in components that have `"use client"` directive because:
- Metadata is processed at build time by the server
- Client components run in the browser and cannot provide build-time metadata
- Server components handle metadata exports correctly

### Solution Applied
1. **Analyzed Dependencies**: Verified that legal and docs pages don't require client-side JavaScript
2. **Removed Client Directives**: Converted pages from client to server components
3. **Preserved Metadata**: Kept all SEO metadata intact while fixing the export issues
4. **Cleaned Up**: Removed duplicate/legacy page files

## Build Verification
