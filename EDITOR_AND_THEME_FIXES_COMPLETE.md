# PlaneMail Editor and Theme Fixes - COMPLETE

## Issues Fixed ✅

### 1. Draft Posts Not Visible in Production
**Problem**: Draft posts were being filtered out in the posts page, making them invisible to users.

**Solution**: 
- Implemented tabbed navigation on the posts page with "All Posts", "Drafts", and "Published" tabs
- Updated filtering logic to show appropriate posts based on selected tab
- Added dynamic empty state messages for each tab
- Set default tab to "All Posts" to show everything by default

**Files Modified**:
- `/apps/web/src/app/(app)/posts/page.tsx`

### 2. Light/Dark Theme Inconsistency in Notion-Style Editor
**Problem**: The editor was using hardcoded colors that didn't respond to theme changes, especially visible in slash commands, bubble menu, and code blocks.

**Solution**:
- Replaced all hardcoded colors in `editor.css` with theme-aware CSS variables
- Updated slash commands, bubble menu, code blocks, blockquotes, links, and selection styling
- Modified Highlight extension to use theme variables instead of hardcoded colors
- Removed all `dark:` prefixes in favor of CSS custom properties

**Files Modified**:
- `/apps/web/src/components/novel/editor.css`
- `/apps/web/src/components/novel/editor.tsx` (Highlight extension)

### 3. Missing Text Alignment Options
**Problem**: The editor lacked text alignment options (left, center, right, justify) in both the bubble menu and slash commands.

**Solution**:
- Installed and configured `@tiptap/extension-text-align` package
- Added text alignment buttons to the bubble menu with proper icons and active states
- Added text alignment commands to the slash command menu
- Imported alignment icons from Lucide React

**Files Modified**:
- `/apps/web/src/components/novel/editor.tsx` (bubble menu alignment buttons)
- `/apps/web/src/components/novel/slash-commands.tsx` (slash command alignment options)
- `package.json` (added @tiptap/extension-text-align dependency)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Text Alignment Extension Configuration
```tsx
TextAlign.configure({
  types: ['heading', 'paragraph'],
  alignments: ['left', 'center', 'right', 'justify'],
  defaultAlignment: 'left',
})
```

### Bubble Menu Alignment Buttons
Added four alignment buttons with:
- Proper active states using `editor.isActive({ textAlign: 'alignment' })`
- Click handlers that call `editor.chain().focus().setTextAlign('alignment').run()`
- Icons from Lucide React (AlignLeft, AlignCenter, AlignRight, AlignJustify)

### Slash Commands Alignment Options
Added four new slash commands:
- "Align Left" - `/` → Align Left
- "Align Center" - `/` → Align Center  
- "Align Right" - `/` → Align Right
- "Align Justify" - `/` → Align Justify

### Theme System Implementation
The editor now uses CSS custom properties that automatically adapt to light/dark themes:
- `--novel-stone-50` through `--novel-stone-950` for grayscale colors
- `--novel-blue-500` for accent colors
- Proper contrast ratios maintained in both themes

## Verification

✅ **Build Status**: Project builds successfully without errors
✅ **Draft Posts**: Now visible in the "All Posts" and "Drafts" tabs
✅ **Theme Consistency**: Editor components respond properly to theme changes
✅ **Text Alignment**: Available in both bubble menu and slash commands
✅ **No Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality preserved
